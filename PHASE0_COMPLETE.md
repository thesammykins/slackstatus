### 6. Example Configurations
- [x] **Example Schedules**
  - `examples/schedule.json` - Comprehensive example with all rule types
  - `examples/simple-schedule.json` - Basic example for getting started
  - Real-world use cases (focus time, lunch breaks, WFH days, holidays)
  - Proper timezone and time format examples

### 7. CI/CD Foundation
- [x] **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - Multi-Node.js version testing (18.x, 20.x)
  - Linting and format checking
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Security scanning with npm audit and TruffleHog
  - macOS build preparation (placeholder for Swift app)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Highlights

### Architecture Decisions
1. **ES Modules**: Modern JavaScript with full ES module support
2. **Luxon for Dates**: Robust timezone handling with DST support
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between scheduler, validator, and Slack client
4. **Functional Design**: Immutable operations, pure functions where possible
5. **Error-First**: Comprehensive error handling at every level

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Rule Evaluation Engine**: Supports all planned rule types with timezone awareness
2. **Slack Integration**: Complete user profile status management
3. **Validation System**: Prevents invalid configurations from running
4. **Dry-Run Support**: Safe testing without API calls
5. **Logging & Debugging**: Comprehensive logging with sensitive data protection

### Security & Privacy
1. **Token Protection**: Automatic scrubbing in logs, secure storage patterns
2. **User Token Only**: Proper validation for user tokens vs bot tokens
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Only requires `users.profile:write` scope
4. **No Data Transmission**: All processing happens locally or in user-controlled environments

## ðŸ§ª Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 52 tests covering all core functionality
- **Integration Points**: Slack API client with mocking
- **Edge Cases**: DST transitions, timezone boundaries, invalid inputs
- **Error Conditions**: Malformed configs, network failures, invalid tokens
- **CLI Testing**: All commands tested with various input combinations

## ðŸ“Š Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~2,800 lines of implementation + tests
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage of core functionality
- **Linting**: Zero ESLint errors with strict configuration
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, well-maintained dependencies only
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 1

The foundation is now solid for Phase 1 development:

1. **Core Logic Complete**: Rule evaluation and Slack integration working
2. **Testing Framework**: Ready for additional test development
3. **CLI Foundation**: Can be extended with export commands
4. **Documentation Structure**: Ready for GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Worker guides
5. **Code Quality**: Standards established and enforced

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1 Readiness Checklist
